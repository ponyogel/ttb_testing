Severity: Critical
Reasoning:
    - The user enters the correct PIN, but the system incorrectly validates it as wrong.
    - After 3 attempts, the system locks the user’s PIN, preventing any further transactions.
    - This affects a core banking function (transfer to other bank).

Priority: Urgent
Reasoning:
    - The defect blocks users from transferring money externally, which is a primary business function in mobile banking.
